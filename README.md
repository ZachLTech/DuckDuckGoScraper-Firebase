# Firebase-Puppeteering

Yeah so I made a DuckDuckGo scraper [here](https://github.com/ZachLTech/duckduckgo-scraper) and decided to integrate firebase for educational purposes and made it a cloud function which would return the results organized in a DB with Firestore

## Usage

I mean if you want to try the scraper, go to [the original project repo](https://github.com/ZachLTech/duckduckgo-scraper) but to test with firebase I suggest you find tutorials on how to do so and clone this repo to use as your firebase function.
